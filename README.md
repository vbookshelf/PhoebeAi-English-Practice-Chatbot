## What problem does this solve?

English is the language of international business, science and technology. Many people across the world want to learn english.

One of the best ways to learn a new language is to actually use it. The challenge many face is that they don't have english speaking friends to practice with or they are too shy to start an english conversation. Also, the english person needs to be patient, understanding and speak slowly. This is not always easy to find. These are challenges I personally experienced when I studied Spanish while backpacking through South America.

PhoebeAi is a patient english speaking friend who's available to text chat 24/7. The chatbot is a customized version of ChatGPT. Therefore, it has the ability to emulate a pre defined personality. It can also simulate a real conversation. 

## How to run this app

This repo contains two versions of the web app - a PHP version and a Javascript version. The PHP version must be uploaded to a web server. The Javascript version can be run from your desktop. In the Php version the user will not be able to see your API key because the php code runs on the server, therefore it's more secure. It's also possible to upload the JS version to a web server, but take note that it's not secure because your API key will be visible to the user. It's not possible to secure an API key in Javascript.

### 1. PHP Version
- Download the PhoebeAi-Php folder.
- Add your OpenAi API Key in the following file: chatgpt-api-code.php
- Upload all the files to your web server as you would when hosting a website.

### 2. Javacsript Version
- Download the PhoebeAi-JS folder and place it on your desktop.
- Add your OpenAi API Key in the following file: chatgpt-api-code.php
- Double click the index.html file. The app will open in your web browser.
